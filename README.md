# Old-Ugly-Scripts
Just some old scripts I wrote years ago. Ugly, probably unusable, but if you look at these, you'll feel better about your own code. Enjoy !

# Files
AudioVideoConverter.sh :
Just a simple script used to help somebody who does not understand command line to convert audio files. Currently, it is using avconv as conversion backend

Valgrind.sh :
Utility script to "ease" valgrind usage (after some times, I find it now more cryptic, but hey). Cachegrind.sh and Massif.sh are the same scripts, but used to "ease" cachegrind and massif usage respectively

#Disclaimer
Don't ask me how this works, for some I have no idea of what I wrote :D 
As title says, old and ugly !
